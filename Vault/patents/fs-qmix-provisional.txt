Title: Fractal-Symbolic QMIX (FS-QMIX)
Inventors: [Your Name et al.]
Filed: [pending]

Abstract:
A multi-agent reinforcement-learning system combining fractal-dimension variance (D_var)
and symbolic lacunarity regularization (SLR) to weight agent contributions and stabilize
emergent coordination.

Claims:
1. A value-decomposition algorithm using fractal metrics to modulate agent reward shares.
2. Application of symbolic regularizers to maintain interpretable emergent behavior.
3. Deployment in decentralized trading and AI-coordination environments.
