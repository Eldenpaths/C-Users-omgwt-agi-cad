# AGI-CAD Core Project Plan

### Current State (Vault Locked):
- **Task Routing System**: Single-agent vs Multi-agent workflows.
- **Symbolic Engines**: Logic, memory, and task delegation across agents.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Clustering and predictive forecasting.
- **Memory Systems**: Deep-context retrieval and iterative recalculation.

### Future Phases:
1. **Phase 18D (Drift Map Visualization)**:
   - Implement **interactive heatmap zooming**.
   - Real-time event syncing with anomaly clusters.

2. **Phase 18E (Cross-Node Sync)**:
   - Finalize **WebSocket** integration for **real-time data syncing**.
   - Implement **Redis Pub/Sub** for state consistency.

3. **Phase 19 (AI Nexus Integration)**:
   - Integrate **Gemini** and **Claude** for **predictive analysis** and task routing.

4. **Phase 20 (User Contributions)**:
   - Enable **user-submitted data** for anomaly validation.
   - Set up **Human-in-the-Loop** feedback system.

### AI Model Integration:
- **Gemini**: For advanced **predictive modeling** and **task management**.
- **Claude**: For **logical reasoning** and **complex analysis**.
- Integration of these models will happen once their respective extensions are available.

### AI Collaboration:
- **Task Delegation**: Expertise-based routing between agents (e.g., Claude for logic, OpenAI for code generation).
- **Memory Anchoring**: Deep-context retrieval systems for updating past builds.

### Next Steps:
1. **Create Document**: The plan will be documented in a **central file** (`project_plan.md` or similar).
2. **Vault Lock**: Lock the document into the vault to preserve the current state and future plans.
3. **AI Model Sync**: Once **Gemini** and **Claude** are ready, integrate them with this plan to ensure consistency.
