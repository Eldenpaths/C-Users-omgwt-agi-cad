Science Labs (Plasma Lab)OverviewModular simulation environments where agents can interact with complex models. The Plasma Lab is the reference implementation, allowing agents to test physics parameters.Status✅ OperationalFilessrc/app/labs/plasma/page.tsxsrc/components/labs/plasma/PlasmaLab.tsxsrc/components/labs/LabControls.tsxsrc/agents/simwright.ts (Used to run the simulation)Components<PlasmaLab />: The main UI for the Plasma Lab, including controls and visualization.API Endpoints/src/pages/api/labs/plasma/run: (Inferred) Triggers a Simwright run.Dependencies(Internal) SimwrightAgent: Used to execute the simulation logic.(Internal) WebGPU Rendering System: (Planned) For visualizing the plasma.UsageUsers interact with the <LabControls /> component.On "Run," the UI calls the SimwrightAgent via the IntelligenceRouter.ConfigurationN/ATestingRun the Plasma Lab and confirm that a simwright task is created and logged to the VAULT.Known IssuesSimulation is currently a stub (simwright.ts only writes to /tmp).Visualization is not yet connected to WebGPU.Future EnhancementsImplement the full physics model for the Plasma Lab.Build the Spectral Lab and Crypto Lab components.Connect lab outputs directly to the LearningCore as training data.
