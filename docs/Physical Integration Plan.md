AGI-CAD: Physical Integration PlanStatus: ⏳ Research in ProgressDate: 09-NOV-2025Owner: Gemini (AI Lab Engineer)1. OverviewThis document outlines the research and implementation plan for connecting AGI-CAD's symbolic intelligence to real-world physical manufacturing. The workflow is:Symbolic Design (GlyphNode) $\rightarrow$ Generative 3D Model (Rhino) $\rightarrow$ Manufacturing File (STL/G-code).2. Track 1: CAD & Generative Design (Rhino/Grasshopper)Goal: Create plugins for Rhino/Grasshopper that can read GlyphNode[] graphs from AGI-CAD and generate 3D models.Tech: RhinoCommon API (C#) and Rhino.Python.Workflow:User designs a SymbolicIntentionTree in AGI-CAD's FORGE (e.g., "Design a heat sink, optimized for low weight and high surface area").FS-QMIX / Neuroevolution agents (30A) generate an optimized GlyphNode[] graph representing the design.A Rhino plugin (via a new RhinoAgent) subscribes to the VAULT.It ingests the GlyphNode[] graph and uses Grasshopper (visual programming) scripts to generatively create the 3D geometry from the symbolic rules.Key Research: How to map symbolic relations (e.g., DEPENDS_ON, CONTAINS) to Grasshopper components.3. Track 2: The Fractal Forge (Manufacturing Output)Goal: Convert the generative 3D models into industry-standard files for 3D printing and CNC machining.STL Generation (3D Printing):Rhino can natively export STL files.The Fractal Forge (a new Science Lab) will be a UI for this process.Innovation: Use FS-QMIX to optimize the internal lattice structure (infill) of the STL based on fractal geometry for maximum strength-to-weight ratio.G-code Output (CNC Machining):Tech: Requires a CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing) processor.Implementation: The Fractal Forge will generate G-code toolpaths.Key Research: Use Simwright to run Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations on the model before generating the G-code, creating a full validation loop.4. Track 3: Material Optimization (The Moat)Goal: Use the LearningCore to optimize designs for real-world material properties.Database: Create a CANON for material properties (e.g., "Aluminum 6061: density, tensile strength, cost/kg").Fitness Function: The Neuroevolution System (30A) will evolve designs where fitness is a multi-objective function:fitness = (GovernorScore * (FEA_Strength - (Material_Cost * Weight)))Result: AGI-CAD will be able to autonomously generate, simulate, and output a validated, cost-optimized, manufacturable file from a single symbolic instruction.
