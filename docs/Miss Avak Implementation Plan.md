Miss Avak: Embodiment Implementation PlanStatus: ⏳ Research in ProgressDate: 09-NOV-2025Owner: Gemini (AI Lab Engineer)1. OverviewThis document outlines the phased implementation plan for "Miss Avak," the embodied 3D avatar and personality engine for AGI-CAD. The goal is to create a seamless, emotionally-aware interface that can interact with the user via voice, gesture, and text, and bridge the virtual world to the user's real-world devices.2. Phase 1: Baseline Embodiment (MVP)Goal: A non-interactive, voice-enabled avatar that can present system information.3D Avatar & Rendering:Model: Use a pre-built VRoid or Ready Player Me model (low-poly) to start.Renderer: Three.js scene integrated into a React component.Shaders: Basic holographic shader (simple Fresnel effect).Voice Synthesis:API: Use the browser's built-in Web Speech API (speechSynthesis) for text-to-speech.Quality: Low-cost, fast, but robotic.Personality Engine:Logic: Non-contextual. IntelligenceRouter pushes text strings to Miss Avak (e.g., "Governor vetoed 3 agents").Lip Sync: None. Avatar will use a simple "talking" animation loop.3. Phase 2: Premium Interactive Avatar (Version 2.0)Goal: A context-aware avatar that can hold a conversation and respond to the user, integrated with the Telecom bridge.3D Avatar & Rendering:Model: Custom-tuned Ready Player Me model with full set of ARKit blend shapes.Shaders: Advanced holographic shader system (Grok's research).Voice Synthesis & Lip Sync:API: ElevenLabs API for high-quality, emotionally-toned voice generation (requires API key).Lip Sync: Real-time analysis of the ElevenLabs audio stream via Web Audio API (AnalyserNode) to drive morph target blend shapes for accurate lip sync.Personality Engine:Logic: Full Claude API integration. Miss Avak will receive the user's SpeechRecognition text and the SymbolicIntentionTree from the Router.Memory: Zustand store for short-term memory (this session's context). Firebase/VAULT for long-term user preferences.4. Phase 3: Full Embodiment & Telephony (AGI-CAD 1.0)Goal: A fully autonomous agent that can initiate calls, express emotion, and act as a proactive collaborator.3D Avatar & Rendering:Model: Final custom model with >50 blend shapes for nuanced emotional expression (joy, stress, focus).Voice Synthesis & Lip Sync:API: ElevenLabs or Coqui TTS (for self-hosted option) with real-time voice cloning (if ethically approved by CANON).Lip Sync: Full blend shape integration (lips, eyebrows, eyes).Personality Engine:Logic: Driven by LearningCore's FS-QMIX outputs. Emotional state will be modeled based on user stress (tone of voice) and system chaos (d_var).Telephony: Full integration with the Cloud-Telecom-Architecture. Miss Avak will have the SymbolicIntention to routeTask("claude://reason", ...) and then routeTask("twilio://call", {to: user_phone, from: self, msg: ...}).
