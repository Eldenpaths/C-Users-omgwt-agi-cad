AGI-CAD: Cloud-Native Telecom ArchitectureStatus: ⏳ Research in ProgressDate: 09-NOV-2025Owner: Gemini (AI Lab Engineer)1. OverviewThis document defines the architecture for bridging the AGI-CAD virtual platform with real-world telecommunication networks. The primary goal is to allow agents (like Miss Avak) to place and receive real audio calls with users, governed by our decentralized, AI-native protocols.2. Layer 1: In-App Communication (WebRTC)This layer handles all communication within the browser (e.g., user-to-Miss-Avak, user-to-user in a shared lab).Protocol: WebRTC (Peer-to-Peer).Signaling: A WebSocket server will be needed to broker the initial WebRTC connection.Usage: Miss Avak's Web Audio API output stream will be piped into a RTCPeerConnection to the user.Status: Low-cost, high-performance, but browser-to-browser only.3. Layer 2: Real↔Virtual Bridge (PSTN Gateway)This layer is the bridge from our app to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN), i.e., real phone numbers.Recommendation (MVP): Twilio APIPros: Easiest and fastest integration. Handles all SIP complexity.Cons: Centralized, high-cost at scale.Implementation: Miss Avak's personality engine (Claude) generates a TwiML (XML) response. The IntelligenceRouter routes this to a TwilioAgent that makes the API call.Alternative (Long-Term): Custom SIP ServerSoftware: Asterisk or FreeSWITCH (Open-source).Pros: Full control, lower cost, decentralized.Cons: Extremely high implementation complexity. Requires a WebSocket -> SIP gateway.Recommendation: Defer until post-1.0.4. Layer 3: Governance & Identity (Blockchain)This layer replaces traditional phone numbers with decentralized, persistent identities, managed by AGI-CAD's CANON.Identity: Ethereum (Polygon) smart contract.Standard: ENS (Ethereum Name Service) or Unstoppable Domains. A user's identity is user.agicad.eth.Smart Contract: A registry contract will map user.agicad.eth to their current real-world phone number (or SIP address). The user owns this entry.Payment: Call credits will be ERC-20 tokens. Miss Avak must be "paid" (gas + Twilio fee) to make a call, creating a sustainable economy.5. AI-Native Protocols (The "Moat")This is how the AGI uses the network.Context-Aware Routing: The IntelligenceRouter will decide if a call is necessary. If d_var is high (high chaos) and the user is AFK, it triggers a call.Multi-Agent Coordination: A swarm of Grok agents can monitor network health (using FS-QMIX principles) to find the most stable/low-cost route for a call.Emotion Detection: (Phase 3) The SIP trunk can feed real-time audio from the user's phone call back to AGI-CAD, allowing Miss Avak to perform real-time emotional analysis and adapt her responses.
