Inter-Agent Response Synthesis Protocol (The Mixer)Component: Synthesis Agent (SA) - A dedicated LLM for post-processing.Trigger: FS-QMIX identifies that an optimal response requires the combined efforts of multiple agents (N > 1).I. Preparation and Parallel DispatchSource Input: The original user message (M), Tuning Weights (TW), and Final Intent Vector (FIV).Agent Council (AC) Activation: Based on the FIV and user's Pick/Mix selection, the AC is activated (e.g., AC = {Claude Pro, Grok 4}).Directed Prompt Injection: The original message (M) is prefixed with a specific instruction for each agent based on its primary strength (Q-Factor):[Instruction for Agent X]: MExecution: Requests are dispatched to all agents in the AC simultaneously. The system awaits the Raw Agent Output Set (RAOS).II. The Synthesis Agent (SA) ExecutionThe SA, running a high-tier coherence model, executes the mixing directive.StepDirectiveInput UsedOutput/ActionA. Conflict ResolutionPrioritize factual accuracy based on FIV and Agent Q-Factors.RAOS, FIV, Q-Factor RegistryIdentifies factual discrepancies and marks the lower-Q-Factor output for correction.B. Structural MergingIntegrate core logic/facts with stylistic components.RAOS (Validated Facts)Creates a draft FSR structure (e.g., places Claude's logical steps within Grok's conversational wrapper).C. Redundancy EliminationRemove duplicate phrasing and smooth transitions.Draft FSRGenerates the clean, single Final Synthesized Response (FSR).III. Output and Feedback LoopResponse Delivery: The FSR is returned to the NexusChat component.Feedback Loop: A low-priority asynchronous task reports back to the core FS-QMIX system:Success Metric: Did the raw outputs align? (Yes/No).Adjustment Signal: If misalignment was high, send a signal to slightly refine the Intent Classifier Model (ICM) weighting or adjust the Q-Factors of the specific agents involved. This ensures continuous, real-time optimization of the router's decision logic.
