AGI-CAD: Component-by-Component Theme SpecsStatus: ⏳ In ProgressOwner: Gemini (UI/IX Architect)1. OverviewThis document provides the detailed implementation specifications for applying the three core themes (Arcane, Neon, Cosmic) to AGI-CAD's 8 primary components.This file serves as the build guide for our AI dev team (Claude, GPT, Gemini).2. Component: Nexus GraphThe 6-layout symbolic graph visualization system.ThemeImplementation DetailsKey Effects1. Arcane BlueprintBackground: Animated, scrolling parchment texture (bg-[url(...)] animate-pan-slow).Nodes: Rendered as hand-drawn golden "ink" circles. Use a Three.js SpriteMaterial with a custom-drawn texture.Edges: Thin, golden lines (var(--color-glyph-line)), with a subtle "ink bleed" pulse animation on selection.Text: font-serif (e.g., 'EB Garamond'), text-text-header.text-shadow: 0 0 5px var(--color-glyph-glow-primary); on labels.Selected nodes have a "wet ink" Sprite bloom.2. Blade Runner NeonBackground: Dark grid background (bg-gray-900) with a subtle radial-gradient from below.Nodes: PointsMaterial (Three.js) with blending: AdditiveBlending. Color: var(--color-accent-primary) (e.g., bright cyan or magenta).Edges: LineBasicMaterial (Three.js) with transparent: true, opacity: 0.5.Text: font-mono (e.g., 'Fira Code'), text-accent-primary.filter: drop-shadow(0 0 8px var(--color-accent-primary)); on labels.Use UnrealBloomPass (post-processing) for intense glow on selected nodes.Holographic shader on info panels.3. Cosmic GrimoireBackground: Live Three.js starfield/nebula shader (see Shader-Library.md).Nodes: Three.js Mesh with SphereGeometry and ShaderMaterial. Nodes are "stars" or "planets" with custom shaders (e.g., a pulsing corona).Edges: LineDashedMaterial representing "constellations."Text: font-sans (e.g., 'Inter'), text-text-header.AdditiveBlending on node materials for a "lit-from-within" look.Heavy use of Bloom post-processing.Selected nodes have an animated ring mesh.3. Component: Learning Panel (Telemetry)The UI displaying FS-QMIX simulation data (fitness, latency, d_var charts).ThemeImplementation DetailsKey Effects1. Arcane BlueprintPanel: bg-bg-component (dark parchment) with border-2 border-amber-800 (looks like wood/gold inlay).Chart.js: borderColor: 'var(--color-accent-primary)' (gold). backgroundColor: 'var(--color-accent-primary-translucent)'.Labels: font-serif, text-text-body.box-shadow: inset 0 0 10px #00000050; on the panel to give it depth.Text has a subtle text-shadow.2. Blade Runner NeonPanel: Translucent glass effect. bg-bg-component-translucent (#0A192F90). backdrop-filter: blur(12px);. border border-cyan-500/50.Chart.js: borderColor: 'var(--color-accent-primary)' (cyan). pointBorderColor: '#fff'. pointRadius: 4.Labels: font-mono, text-accent-primary.box-shadow: 0 0 20px var(--color-accent-primary-translucent); on the panel.Chart lines have a filter: drop-shadow(...).3. Cosmic GrimoirePanel: bg-transparent. The panel "floats" over the cosmic background.Chart.js: borderColor: '#ffffff' (white/starlight). backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)'.Labels: font-sans, text-white.text-shadow: 0 0 5px #ffffff80; on all text.The chart grid lines are rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2) to look like constellation guides.4. Component: Science Labs UI (Stubs)Controls and views for Plasma Lab, etc.Arcane: Looks like an alchemist's workbench. Brass/gold sliders, parchment readouts.Neon: Looks like a cyberpunk rig. Glitchy readouts, holographic sliders.Cosmic: Looks like a starship control panel. Floating, ethereal controls.5. Component: Router Control Panel (Stubs)The UI for dispatching tasks to the IntelligenceRouter.Arcane: A "spellbook" interface. User selects "runes" (agents) to cast a "spell" (task).Neon: A "cyberdeck" terminal. User types commands, routes are shown as glowing data traces.Cosmic: An "astrolabe." User aligns "constellations" (tasks, agents, context) to initiate a workflow.6. Component: Mission Control Dashboard (Stubs)High-level overview of the entire AGI-CAD system.Arcane: A "scrying mirror" or "divination table."Neon: A "holographic city map" (like the "war room" in sci-fi films).Cosmic: An "orrery" (model of the solar system) showing agents as planets.7. Component: Forge Interface (Stubs)The main SymbolicIntentionTree editor.Arcane: A literal "tree" diagram drawn with "ink" on parchment.Neon: A "node editor" (like Unreal Blueprints) with glowing neon wires.Cosmic: A "mind map" of floating stars and nebulae.8. Component: Governor Analytics (Stubs)Displays CVRA and Semantic Fidelity audit results.Arcane: A "judge's ledger" or "book of laws."Neon: A "security operations center" (SOC) dashboard.Cosmic: A "cosmic balance" scale visualization.9. Component: Agent Hub (Stubs)UI for managing the Neuroevolution swarm.Arcane: An "alchemist's bestiary" or "golem workshop."Neon: A "cloning vat" or "cybernetic assembly line."Cosmic: An "evolutionary nebula" where new agent "stars" are born.
