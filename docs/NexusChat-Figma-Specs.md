Nexus Chat: Figma Prototype Specifications (Arcane Blueprint Theme)Owner: Gemini (UI/IX Architect)Goal: Define the visual structure, flow, and golden/mystical accents for the AI Router.1. Overall Layout & AestheticTheme Foundation: Arcane Blueprint.Background: Use the animated parchment texture (if possible) or a very dark, textured background (bg-bg-page) with subtle golden borders and dividers (border-border-primary).Accent Color: Dominated by var(--color-accent-primary) (Deep Gold/Amber).Fonts: Header text uses the mystical/serif font defined in ThemeFonts.header. Body text is legible (ThemeFonts.body).2. Component Structure (Split Panel)The screen is divided into two primary vertical panels:A. Left Panel: Nexus Chat Interface (Default View)Primary Focus: Free-tier access and chat history.Header: Title "Nexus Chat" in the golden header font.OAuth Bar: A prominent, high-contrast banner at the top of the chat history area.Text: "Access the Council: Sign in to unlock full potential."Buttons: Mass OAuth sign-in buttons (Google, GitHub, Microsoft) using the bg-accent-primary class.Input Area: A large input field at the bottom. The send button is an embossed golden seal icon.Model Indicator: A small rune icon next to the input, indicating the currently active free model (e.g., "Grok Free").B. Right Panel: Router/Upgrade Control (The Grimoire)Title: "The Architect's Grimoire: Model Selection & Tuning."Structure: Designed as a tiered stack of components, emphasizing progression.3. Right Panel Detailed Sections3.1 Tier Status & Upgrade PathFree Tier Display: "Current Tier: Novice Rune-Scribe (Free)." Text color is muted (text-text-muted).Upgrade Card: A high-contrast, glowing card (use glow-component-active) encouraging subscription.Title: "Unlock the Council of Pro-Agents: $20/mo."Call to Action: Golden, embossed button: "Begin the Ascent" (leads to subscription flow).3.2 Pick/Mix UI (Pro/Plus Tiers Only)Component: A dynamic grid or list showing available paid models (Claude Pro, Grok 4, etc.).Interaction: Checkboxes or toggles. When selected, the model's icon appears in a small "Active Agents" list above the chat.Visual: Each model card has a small golden border and glows subtly on selection.3.3 Recommendation Engine DisplayTitle: "Guidance from the Oracle (FS-QMIX Recommendation)."Display: A dynamically updated card based on user input intent (e.g., if the user asks a complex logical question, the Oracle suggests: "Optimal for Reasoning: Claude Pro + Grok 4 Combination").Visual: Text output is in the text-accent-primary color and uses a distinct, slightly italicized font.3.4 Fine-Tuning SlidersSliders: A set of vertical sliders for prompt weight adjustment (e.g., "Creativity," "Reasoning Depth," "Factual Grounding").Knobs: Custom golden knobs with subtle micro-animations (e.g., a faint shimmer/pulse animation using Framer Motion).Purpose: These sliders adjust the weighting of the user's intent vector before it hits the FS-QMIX router, allowing the user to guide the model selection process.
