FS-QMIX Intent-Based Router Logic for Nexus ChatGoal: Define how the user's intent and tier are used by the FS-QMIX system to select the optimal model combination.1. FS-QMIX Role: Intent Classification (Layer 1)The FS-QMIX (Factorized State-Quality Mixing) Router acts as the primary decision-maker, not just a load balancer.Input: The user's query (message) + their current Tuning Weights (Creativity, Reasoning, Grounding).Intent Vector Generation: FS-QMIX first runs the query through a small, specialized Intent Classifier Model (ICM). The ICM assigns a raw probability distribution to the query (e.g., [Reasoning: 0.8, Creative: 0.1, Summarization: 0.1]).Tuning Weight Blending: The user's sliders modulate this raw vector.Example: If Raw Reasoning is 0.8, but the user set the "Reasoning Depth" slider to 20/100, FS-QMIX down-weights the Reasoning factor for the final routing decision, even if the query seems logical. This respects user preference over raw classification.Output: A Final Intent Vector (FIV).2. Tiered Model Registry (Layer 2)The router maintains a registry of available models and their known performance "quality factors" (Q-Factors) across different intent dimensions.ModelReasoning Q-FactorCreative Q-FactorMultimodal Q-FactorAccess TierClaude Pro0.950.500.20ProGrok 40.800.900.10ProGemini Pro0.700.750.90PlusHugging Face (Llama)0.400.300.10FreeRouting Logic based on Tier and FIV:IF User is FREE Tier:Selection: The router is restricted to Free models (Llama, Mistral Free, etc.).Decision: Select the Free model with the highest Q-Factor matching the dominant intent in the FIV.IF User is PLUS/PRO Tier:Selection: Check the user's "Pick/Mix" selection.Decision:If 1+ Pro Models Selected (Pick/Mix Active): The router uses the FIV to dynamically weigh and query the selected models, favoring the one with the highest relevant Q-Factor.If NO Pro Models Selected (Default Pro): The router automatically selects the single highest-performing agent from the entire Pro registry based on the FIV.3. Recommendation Engine (The Oracle)The Recommendation Engine is a passive function of FS-QMIX.Process: After generating the FIV but before the final routing decision, FS-QMIX calculates the Theoretical Optimal Agent Set (TOAS) by multiplying the FIV against the full Q-Factor registry (regardless of user tier).Output: The TOAS (e.g., "Claude Pro + Grok 4") is displayed in the "Guidance from the Oracle" panel, showing the user the best possible combination for their current query, serving as a continuous soft-sell for the upgrade path.
