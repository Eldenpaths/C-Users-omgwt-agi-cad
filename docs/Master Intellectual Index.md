Master AGI-CAD Intellectual IndexLast Scanned: $$Date$$ by agent:echo_archivistThis document is the canonical index of all proprietary intellectual property, technical breakthroughs, and core systems developed for the AGI-CAD Symbolic Operating System.I. Core Breakthroughs (The "Untachable" Moat)This section details the novel, patentable mathematics and algorithms that define AGI-CAD's core intelligence.|| Breakthrough | Symbol | Description | Status || FS-QMIX/SLR | IP.FS-QMIX.01 | Hierarchical Fractal-Symbolic Decomposition for Emergent Hive Intelligence. Uses Differentiable Correlation Dimension Variance ($\hat{D}_{var}$) to condition MARL mixing weights, and Symbolic Lacunarity Regularization ($\text{SLR}$) for stable, fluid exploration. | Patent Pending (Conceptual) || Canon-Vault Reconciliation Agent | IP.CVRA.01 | Self-Governing Audit Agent. Audits immutable VAULT history against locked CANON ground truths to automatically detect and propose beneficial DEVIATIONS. | TM (Tech Mark) Filed || Symbolic Intention Tree | IP.SIT.01 | AI Command Protocol. A structured, tree-based instruction format that includes goal, context, CANON constraints, and chaos thresholds ($\hat{D}_{var}$), replacing flat-text prompts. | Internal Standard |II. Technical Systems & APIsThis section covers all major software components, microservices, and APIs.| System/API | Classification | Route Key | Status || Intelligence Router | AI & Learning | router://core | Prototype || VAULT (Firestore) | Core OS | db://vault_logs | Deployed (MVP) || CANON (UI/State) | Core OS | ui://canon | Deployed (MVP) || FORGE (UI) | Core OS | ui://forge | Deployed (MVP) || Plasma Lab | Simulation & Physics | lab://plasma | Deployed (MVP) || Spectral Lab | Simulation & Physics | lab://spectral | DeMethod || Crypto Area | Simulation & Financial | lab://crypto | In Progress |III.
